**MyToken Smart Contract**
**Overview**
The MyToken smart contract is an ERC20-like token implementation written in Solidity. It allows users to create, transfer, mint, and burn tokens. The contract is designed to manage a simple token economy with features such as airdrops and allowances for delegated transfers.

**Features**
Token Name: BRAHMAN
Token Abbreviation: BMN
Total Supply: 50,000 tokens (initially assigned to the contract creator)
Minting: Allows the creation of new tokens and assignment to specified addresses.
Burning: Enables users to destroy their tokens, reducing the total supply.
Transfer: Users can transfer tokens to other addresses.
Airdrop: Distribute tokens to multiple addresses in a single transaction.
Allowance: Users can approve others to spend a specified amount of their tokens.
**Contract Functions**
1. Constructor
constructor(): Initializes the token with a name, abbreviation, and total supply. Assigns the initial supply to the contract creator.
2. Minting
mint(address _address, uint _value): Increases the total supply and assigns the specified amount of tokens to the given address.
3. Burning
burn(uint _value): Reduces the total supply and the caller's balance by the specified amount. Requires sufficient balance.
4. Transfer
transfer(address _to, uint _value): Transfers tokens from the caller's account to the specified address. Requires sufficient balance.
5. Airdrop
airdrop(address[] memory _addresses, uint _value): Mints tokens for multiple addresses in a single transaction.
6. Approval
approve(address _spender, uint _value): Allows a spender to withdraw from the caller's account multiple times, up to the specified amount.
7. Transfer From
transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _value): Allows a spender to transfer tokens on behalf of another address, given that the allowance is sufficient.
8. Balance and Allowance Queries
balanceOf(address _owner): Returns the token balance of the specified address.
allowance(address _owner, address _spender): Returns the remaining number of tokens that a spender is allowed to spend on behalf of the owner.
**Events**
Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint value): Emitted when tokens are transferred.
Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint value): Emitted when an approval is made.
Mint(address indexed to, uint value): Emitted when new tokens are minted.
Burn(address indexed from, uint value): Emitted when tokens are burned.
**Usage**
Deploy the Contract: Deploy the MyToken contract on an Ethereum-compatible blockchain.
Mint Tokens: Use the mint function to create new tokens for specific addresses.
Transfer Tokens: Call the transfer function to send tokens to other users.
Burn Tokens: Users can call the burn function to reduce their token balance.
Airdrop Tokens: Use the airdrop function to distribute tokens to multiple addresses at once.
Check Balances and Allowances: Use balanceOf and allowance functions to check token balances and allowances.
